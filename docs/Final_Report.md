## Question

As students in MDS who are completing their degree, we were curious about the experience of our classmates over the course of the program. There is a general consensus that the two toughest blocks (4 courses per block) of month long material were covered in January and February, which were blocks 4 and 5. While both were considered difficult they were quite different in educational content.

Block 4 contained coursework on extensive concepts in machine learning, ranging from ML algorithms, deep learning, feature and model selection, regularization, among other topics generally taught within the computing science department. On the other hand, Block 5 contained statistics courses covering regression, time-series/spatial statistics, and Bayesian statistics. 

Our interest in this experiment was to consider the background of students, and the role this played in their perception of the more difficult block (4 or 5). The background we chose to explore in our survey contained the following questions: Educational Background (Faculty) of last degree, Field/Major, Occupational History (last job held), Age, Sex (Male or Female or Prefer Not to Say), and Block Difficulty (Which was harder? 4 or 5?).

Our hypothesis is that students with a statistics/math/life science background (education or occupation) will rate the machine learning block (Block-4) as the harder block, whereas students with a computer-science background (education or occupation) will rate the statistics block (Block-5) as the more difficult one. We believe there is a relationship between educational focus and efficacy in school, and this can be measured by individual perceptions of difficulty in our outcome question.
