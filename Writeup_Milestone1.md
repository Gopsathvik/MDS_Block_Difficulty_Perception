## Perceived Block Difficulty in MDS

> Identify the question that your team is in interested in answering with the survey. The aim of the survey should be to try to answer one specific and testable question. Examples of specific and testable questions include (you can use one of these if you really like them):


Question: **Does the educational backgrounds influence MDS student's perception of block difficulty?**

To explore this question, we'll collect educational background information and attitudes towards the block difficulty in the survey. Since block #4 and #5 are the two most stressful blocks for us, with different course contents, we will ask respondent to select the harder block, which will be the perception data for analysis.


> Identify the other questions you plan to ask in your survey to identify confounding variables and justify/explain why you plan to include them.

> Describe how you plan to analyze the survey results (e.g., what statistical test(s) do you plan to employ?)

The purpose of our experiment is to understand whether different educational backgrounds (IV) are related to perceived block difficulty (DV) of students in MDS. Our educational background variable (IV) is comprised of multiple levels (ex. business, life sciences, comp sci, stats/math, engineering) and perceived block difficulty is a binary outcome where respondents pick the harder block between #4 and #5.

We will utilize a logistic regression model to assess the association between our IV and DV and consider potential confounding variables associated with both our IV and DV in the ensuing analysis as well.
